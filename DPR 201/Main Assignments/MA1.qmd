## I need to create the dataset for this assignment. 
## Students will perform a forecast model of the expected
## magnitude of different Militarized Interstate Confrontations
## using various covariates associated with the countries
## involved. 
##
## I therefore need to creat a confrontation level dataset
## for analysis. I'll use the MIE dataset to build a base.
## Then I'll incorporate additional covariates

## open {tidyverse} and {peacesciencer}
library(tidyverse)
library(peacesciencer)
