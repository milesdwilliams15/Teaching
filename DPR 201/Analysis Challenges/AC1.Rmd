## The Challenge

In this first analysis challenge, imagine that you are an analyst for either the RNC or DNC (it's up to you which one you want to work for). 

The party has collected data on the amount of money they've spent on various U.S. House elections from 2018, along with some details about those districts and the candidates that ran for office. They want you to **look at districts where their candidates** ***lost*** **to understand** ***why***.

Write up a short research note (no more than 700 words) that:

1. Explains (politely!) to party leaders why the analysis they want you to perform is a bad idea.

2. Shows the results from a more appropriate analysis.

For part 1, a paragraph or two should suffice. For 2, look at how party spending in districts and candidate incumbency correlated with winning a greater share of votes in the election. For party spending, create a scatter plot with a regression line. For incumbency, create a column plot showing average vote share for their party's candidate by incumbency.

Before each figure provide a description of the figure (what kind of plot is it? and what are the variables?) and what the figure tells us (are the variables positively or negatively correlated? is there no correlation?).

Conclude with a paragraph summarizing your recommendations for party leaders.

Submit your write-up to Canvas as either a PDF or Word doc.
