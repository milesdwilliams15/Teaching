## Instructions

For this analysis challenge, you'll be presented with a few different causal frameworks. Your task, for each case, is to use that framework to decide which variables you should control for in a multiple regression model, and which you should leave out.

For each scenario you will 

1. Indicate the variables you will control for
2. Justify your choice in a short paragraph

For 2, your reasoning should be guided by one of the following considerations we discussed in the lecture regarding *selection on observables* or SOO designs:

- Minimizing omitted variable bias
- Avoiding controlling for mechanisms
- Avoiding post-treatment bias

## Secnario 1

```{r}
dagify(
  Outcome ~ Treatment + Z1 + Z2,
  Treatment ~ Z1 + Z2
) %>%
  ggdag(
    node = F,
    text_col = "Black"
  )
```

Variables you'd control for:

## Scenario 2

```{r}
dagify(
  Outcome ~ Treatment + Z1 ,
  Treatment ~ Z1,
  Z2 ~ Treatment
) %>%
  ggdag(
    node = F,
    text_col = "Black"
  )
```

## Scenario 3

dagify(
  Outcome ~ Treatment,
  Treatment ~ Z1 + Z2
) %>%
  ggdag(
    node = F,
    text_col = "Black"
  )
