## 

We've been discussing the problem of *p-hacking*, which is the process of changing aspects of your data analysis such as your measures, your sample, and/or your statistical model until you can turn a statistically insignificant result into a significant one. For this analysis challenge I want you to use some data that Bueno de Mesquita and Fowler made available on their book's website. This data gives us an opportunity to ask an interesting question: did prior exposure to Donald Trump in pop-culture influence political behavior in 2016? To capture prior exposure, the survey asked responds two questions: (1) whether they watched *The Apprentice*, a TV show starring Trump, and (2) whether they watched *Home Alone 2*, a movie with a Trump cameo.

Using the data:

1.  See if you can find at least three statistically significant relationships between prior exposure to Trump and political behavior. You're free to look at how individuals voted in 2016 or whether they even voted at all in 2016. You can test whether watching either show or both shows influences one of these outcomes. You can also control for as many or as few additional factors that you want in a regression model. You can also pick and choose what kind of standard errors you'd like to useâ€”classical or robust.
2.  Once you find three statistically significant relationships, interpret them substantively. Have we learned anything new about political behavior in the electorate from your analysis? Write a paragraph summarizing your thoughts.

Once your done, submit your work as a rendered Quarto document with your code visible and your interpretation of the results.
