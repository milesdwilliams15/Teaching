```

Will *Fortune* be your friend? Try your hand at the Flipping Pennies game to see!

Make a function to "flip a penny":
```{r}
penny_flip <- function() sample(c("heads", "tails"), 1)
```

If you run it without any input, it'll give you a result:
```{r}
penny_flip()
```

And again, another result:
```{r}
penny_flip()
```


## Game 1: Tournament

Use this function to compete head to head with a partner. The first to get "heads" while the other gets "tails" wins.

If you win, you'll advance to the next round. If you lose, you'll be eliminated from the tournament.

We'll continue like this until there's one winner.


## Game 2: Round Robin

Play a round with 10 different classmates. The rules are the same as before. The first to get "heads" while the other gets "tails" wins. 

This time, record the number of times you win.
