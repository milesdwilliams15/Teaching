\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

Is democracy worldwide in decline? Are wars becoming less frequent and
deadly? Have politics really become more polarized? These are weighty
questions, and depending on whom you ask, different people will provide
you with different answers.

One of the primary culprits of divergent views in politics is the
alternate bases of fact on which people draw conclusions. While there is
no simple way to reconcile differences in values, it often helps to
document the nature of our political and social world with transparency
and consistency. This offers an objective basis of fact where anecdote
and speculation would normally reign.

One of the most impactful ways of communicating documented facts about
our political and social world is through data visualization. Data are
being generated around us all the time. When people vote, data are
generated. When members of parliament open their mouths, we have data.
Court cases, polling, protests, passing legislation, raising money,
civil wars -- we have data. Especially with large datasets, we really
have no idea what we have until we can \textbf{see it}.

Data visualization is the primary way in which we communicate trends and
relationships to audiences, both public and private. Therefore, a course
on data visualization is primarily a course on communication, where the
data viz tells a story that can be clearly understood with methods that
can be used by anyone to tell the same story.

This course will help you understand data and what to do with it. That
means we will confront all sorts of data and gain techniques to wrangle
it (understand, alter, or give it structure) and then explore a wide
variety of visualization techniques available to us. By the end of the
course, you will speak data and have a sizable data visualization
toolkit. In addition, you will be able to articulate theories of
visualization to explain why you chose a certain visualization and,
though secondary, attach written communication that is as clear as your
data viz.

\hypertarget{course-objectives}{%
\section{Course Objectives}\label{course-objectives}}

In this course, you'll develop a number of skills.

\hypertarget{quantitative}{%
\paragraph{Quantitative}\label{quantitative}}

You will develop your quantitative skills in the treatment of data.
You'll learn how data are gathered, assembled into datasets, and most
effectively visualized to describe and draw inferences for maximum
impact.

\hypertarget{writing}{%
\paragraph{Writing}\label{writing}}

A picture may be worth a thousand words, but it helps if words are
included. When you visualize data you will also write up your results.
This will enhance your writing skills and reinforce the idea that data
visualization is not a mechanical skill; it is a method of inquiry
intended for public communication.

\hypertarget{critical-thinking}{%
\paragraph{Critical Thinking}\label{critical-thinking}}

Critical thinking involves ``confronting multiple, competing
perspectives and adjudicating between them.'' This is the essence of
what is required to organize data, create effective visualizations, and
draw conclusions.

\hypertarget{statistical-programming}{%
\paragraph{Statistical Programming}\label{statistical-programming}}

You will use R and RStudio to wrangle and visualize data. By the time
you have finished this course you may not be an expert programmer, but
you will be well versed in the basics of R and how to use the
\texttt{\{tidyverse\}} suite of packages to assemble, organize, and
visualize data.

\hypertarget{analysis-software}{%
\section{Analysis Software}\label{analysis-software}}

Students will use R and RStudio, which are free and open source! We will
primarily use the RStudio version available through a web browser
installed on a Denison server: \texttt{r.denison.edu}. This can be
accessed on campus on any computer or through a VPN off campus. To use
the VPN:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to myDenison.
\item
  Head to MyApps.
\item
  Select Remote Access.
\item
  Follow the instructions to download and use the VPN.
\end{enumerate}

All necessary R packages for the course are already installed in the
server version. While using the \textbf{Denison server version is highly
recommended}, you are also welcome to download and install local
versions of R and RStudio on your laptop. Follow
\href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{this guide}.

\hypertarget{required-readings}{%
\section{Required Readings}\label{required-readings}}

In addition to reading some short pieces written by journalists,
academics, and others available online, we will primarily draw on Kieran
Healy's excellent book on data viz:

Will Duquette is the Teaching Assistant for DPR 101. If you have
questions about assignments or need help troubleshooting code, Will is
an excellent resource.

\textbf{Office Hours}: Tues. 11:00 am - 12:30 pm / Thurs. 5:00 pm - 6:00

\textbf{Location}: Higley 408

\textbf{Contact}:
\href{mailto:duquet_w1@denison.edu}{\nolinkurl{duquet\_w1@denison.edu}}

\hypertarget{accessibility}{%
\subsection{Accessibility}\label{accessibility}}

Students with a documented disability should complete a Semester Request
for Accommodations through the MyAccommodations app on MyDenison. It is
the student's responsibility to contact me privately as soon as possible
to discuss specific needs and make arrangements well in advance of an
evaluation. I rely on the Academic Resource Center (ARC) located in 020
Higley Hall, to verify the need for reasonable accommodations based on
the documentation on file in that office. Reasonable accommodations
cannot be applied retroactively and therefore ideally should be enacted
early in the semester as they are not automatically carried forward from
a previous term and must be requested every semester.

\hypertarget{writing-center}{%
\subsection{Writing Center}\label{writing-center}}

Staffed by student Writing Consultants, the Writing Center is a free
resource available to all Denison students. Writing Consultants from a
range of majors work with writers one-on-one in all phases of the
writing process, including (but not limited to): deciphering
assignments, discussing ideas, developing an argument, integrating
research and sources, working with faculty feedback, and/or polishing a
draft. In addition, Consultants are happy to help with all types of
writing, from lab reports, research papers, and informal writing
assignments to cover letters, personal statements, and other application
materials. The Center welcomes writers from all backgrounds and levels
of college preparation, including multilingual writers. Should a
multilingual writer need writing assistance that exceeds the abilities
of consultants, the writer can be referred to the Coordinator for
Multilingual Learning, Kaly Thayer
(\href{mailto:thayerk@denison.edu}{\nolinkurl{thayerk@denison.edu}}).
Writing Center consultations will take place in person in in the Atrium
level of the Library; please visit the Writing Center's page
(\url{https://my.denison.edu/campus-resources/writing-center}) on
MyDenison for specific information regarding hours of availability and
how to schedule an appointment. The Writing Center strongly recommends
signing up for appointments in advance.

\hypertarget{multilingual-support-l2}{%
\subsection{Multilingual Support (L2)}\label{multilingual-support-l2}}

Students who use English in addition to other languages are welcome to
use the resources available at the Multilingual Learning Office. Kaly
Thayer, the Assistant Director of Multilingual Learning, and Anna Adams,
the English Language Support Specialist, as well the student consultants
who work with them, are trained and experienced in helping students
address the different issues that arise when working in more than one
language. If English is not your first or only language, please consider
utilizing this resource, which is available to ALL Denison students.
Ms.~Thayer, Ms.~Adams, and the student consultants offer a variety of
support for L2 students, including consulting with you about your
written language (grammar, syntax, word-choices), strategies to manage
your reading assignments, assistance with class conversation and
presentations, and help devising ways to develop and effectively use all
your skills in English. You can set up an appointment via MyDenison -
Campus Resources - Multilingual Learning, or by emailing the
Multilingual Learning Office directly at
\href{mailto:englishhelp@denison.edu}{\nolinkurl{englishhelp@denison.edu}}.

\hypertarget{reporting-sexual-assault}{%
\subsection{Reporting Sexual Assault}\label{reporting-sexual-assault}}

Essays, journals, and other coursework submitted for this class are
generally considered confidential pursuant to the University's student
record policies. However, students should be aware that University
employees are required by University policy to report allegations of
discrimination based on sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression,
sexual orientation or pregnancy to the Title IX Coordinator or a Deputy
Title IX Coordinator. This includes reporting all incidents of sexual
misconduct, sexual assault and suspected abuse/neglect of a minor.
Further, employees are to report these incidents that occur on campus
and/or that involve students at Denison University whenever the employee
becomes aware of a possible incident in the course of their employment,
including via coursework or advising conversations. There are others on
campus to whom you may speak in confidence, including clergy and medical
staff and counselors at the Wellness Center. More information on Title
IX and the University's Policy prohibiting sex discrimination, including
sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, stalking and retaliation,
including support resources, how to report, and prevention and education
efforts, can be found at: \url{https://denison.edu/campus/title-ix} .

Grades at Denison are based on a standard 4.0 scale. You can read more
about Denison's grading system
\href{https://catalog.denison.edu/catalog/academic-program/grading-system-evaluation/}{here}.
Generally, a 90 corresponds to an A\(-\), an 80 to a B\(-\), etc.

\emph{Code Glossary} \textbf{10pts}

\begin{quote}
We're going to be using statistical programming software in this class,
which means you're going to need to learn how to code. There's no
expectation that you have any coding experience prior to taking this
course, but whether you have or haven't coded before, taking notes and
building a repository of code that you can draw on in future work is
essential. That's why I want you not only to take notes in class as we
write code but also to build a code repository that includes examples of
different kinds of data viz and how to process the data used to make
them. The good news is, you won't have to come up with these examples on
your own. If you code along with me in class, you'll have a complete
code glossary by the end of the semester. This will be due April 23, and
I'll check in with you periodically to make sure you're keeping on pace.
\end{quote}

\emph{4 Main Assignments} \textbf{15pts Each}

\begin{quote}
You'll have four main writing assigments to complete in this course.
These will be anywhere form 700 to 1,200 words and usually include at
least 4 data visualizations. The prompts for these assigments will be
made available during the course. These involve wrangling some political
data, describing trends with figures, and a written summary (with your
figures included in-text) of what you find. The final assigment includes
a presentation component, which is graded as completed/not completed.
\end{quote}

\emph{8 Data Challenges} \textbf{3pts Each}

\begin{quote}
These are intended to be a fun and challenging way to practice some data
wrangling and data viz skills. You'll be given data or a data-frame
(you'll learn what that is in the course) and make a graph that tells a
story from the data better than what could be communicated by just
looking at the data on its own. You'll get the necessary data for these
at least 5 days in advance of when they are due. These will be graded
using a mastery-based approach. That means that if you completed the
challenge successfully, that's awesome! You mastered the skills
necessary to do the challenge and you get the full 3pts. But if you
complete the challenge and it doesn't quite cut it, that's okay. You can
try again (and again) until you nail it. Once you do, you'll get the
full 3pts. Until then, you'll get 1pt as a place-holder.
\end{quote}

\emph{Post a Viz} \textbf{6pts Total}

\begin{quote}
This is a low stakes weekly assigment to post before class on Mondays.
You're job is simple. Find a visualization out in nature, post it to
Canvas with its source url, and write a paragraph describing it. Did its
creators make smart display choices? Is there anything that makes it
interesting? Is it just terrible? This assigment will be graded based on
completion (unless it's clear that you didn't try at all).
\end{quote}

\[
\begin{aligned}
6pts& \text{ (Post a Viz)} \\
10pts  & \text{ (Code Glossary)} \\

\textbf{\emph{Wait! What about attendance?}} You're all young adults. I
expect you to come to class and participate. But I won't be taking
attendance (at least not formally). If you can't make it to class for
some reason, then you can't make it to class. But if you start missing
class regularly, your grade will start to suffer. It won't suffer
because you're losing ``participation'' points. It'll suffer because
you're missing out on information provided in class that's necessary for
completing data challenges, doing your main assignments, and building
your code glossary.

\hypertarget{e-mail-policy}{%
\subsection{E-mail Policy}\label{e-mail-policy}}

I have a simple email policy, and it is targeted at achieving one goal:
\textbf{maximizing your and my work-life balance}. The policy is this:

\begin{quote}
I promise a timely response to \textbf{relevant} emails I receive
between \textbf{9:00 AM} and \textbf{5:00 PM} Monday to Friday.
\end{quote}

You may not think professors have lives (but we in fact do, and I like
to live mine outside of normal working hours). That doesn't mean I
expect students to abide by chrono-normative standards.\footnote{By
  this, I simply mean classic societal expectations about working
  vs.~leisure hours.} But, this does mean that if you email me outside
of these windows, I may not respond until the next 9-5 workday.

\hypertarget{make-up-assigment-policy}{%
\subsection{Make-Up Assigment Policy}\label{make-up-assigment-policy}}

There are \textbf{NO} make-ups for missed assignments. Don't bother
asking. But, if you anticipate having troubles making a due-date and
notify me \textbf{\emph{in advance}}, we can work out a solution.

\hypertarget{second-chances-policy}{%
\subsection{Second Chances Policy}\label{second-chances-policy}}

The data challenges have built-in second-chances. That means if your
submission didn't show that you clearly mastered the skills necessary to
do the challenge well, you can try again. The main assignments are a
different story. With these, you have one chance. But only one chance
should be necessary. There are days in class specifically carved out to
work on these. This gives you every opportunity to ask me questions,
have me take a look at your writing and data viz, and check your overall
write-up before you submit it. Take advantage of these opportunities for
feedback \emph{before} you submit. You won't get a second chance after.

\hypertarget{attendance-policy}{%
\subsection{Attendance Policy}\label{attendance-policy}}

Come to class. Attendance is not part of your grade, but poor attendance
will lead to poor grades.

\hypertarget{computer-based-excuses}{%
\subsection{Computer-based Excuses}\label{computer-based-excuses}}

Excuses for late or missed assignments based on CD, flash drive, or hard
drive errors are \textbf{not acceptable}. The Denison network and server
is reliable and accessible. If you use your Google Drive and the RStudio
server, all your work will be backed up and easy to access.

\hypertarget{late-assigments}{%
\subsection{Late Assigments}\label{late-assigments}}

We have a lot of work to do in this class. So turn in your work when
it's due. This is meant to help you. I love to procrastinate just as
much as anyone else---but if you procrastinate in this course, you will
drown. As incentive for keeping on top of your assignments, each day
your assignment is late and unexcused (including weekends and holidays)
you will lose 5 percent from your final grade for that assignment. There
will be no exceptions made for work that is submitted only minutes after
a deadline. If something is due by midnight on a Friday (12:00 AM), the
moment the clock strikes 12:01 AM your assignment is a day late and you
will automatically lose 5\% from your grade.

The exception to this rule is if a student and I have worked out an
arrangement for submitting an assignment at a later date.

\hypertarget{electronic-submission}{%
\subsection{Electronic Submission}\label{electronic-submission}}

You will submit all of your assignments electronically via Canvas.

\hypertarget{academic-dishonesty-policy}{%
\subsection{Academic Dishonesty
Policy}\label{academic-dishonesty-policy}}

Don't cheat. Just don't do it.

It should go without saying, but \textbf{\emph{plagiarism}} is also a
form of cheating and it includes:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Copying or paraphrasing the ideas of others without citation or
  attribution.
\item
  Copying or paraphrasing the ideas of \textbf{\emph{other students in
  the class}}.
\end{enumerate}

I've had to deal with students plagiarizing before. It's painful for me
and it puts a blight on the record of the student. It's not only
cheating, it's stealing.

When in doubt about whether something constitutes cheating, consult
Denison's \href{https://denison.edu/academics/curriculum/integrity}{Code
of Academic
Integrity}.\footnote{Of course, if you have to ask yourself if something counts as cheating, then it probably is...}
Be advised that this same Code of Academic Integrity requires that
instructors notify the Associate Provost of cases of academic
dishonesty. \textbf{Any incidence of academic dishonesty will result in
failure of the course and referral to the Denison judicial process.}
