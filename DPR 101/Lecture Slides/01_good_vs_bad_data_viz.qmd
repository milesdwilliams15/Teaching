## How do we know if a data visualization is good?

-   We could consider factors like objectivity...

-   ...transparency

-   ...clarity

-   ...efficiency

-   Let's look a some examples and see what we think

## Life Expectancy

## Monstrous Costs

## Is democracy essential?

## Depends on how you show the data

## Pie is for eating, and that's all

## So what's wrong with pie?

It's labor intensive! ([see more](https://scc.ms.unimelb.edu.au/resources/data-visualisation-and-exploration/no_pie-charts))

-   You need to add the percentage to every slice.

-   You need to directly label every slice.

-   You have run out of colours for the slices.

-   You will have to explode the chart to solve your first three problems.

## Putting it bluntly

*"Cosmetic decoration, which frequently distorts the data, will never salvage an underlying lack of content"* - Edward Tufte

## Still room for debate

## What makes a good data viz

-   It lets your audience make a quick visual judgment

-   Design elements are used strategically (and sparingly)

-   It is transparent and easy to replicate

-   It uses labels effectively when geometry won't do the trick

## A good data viz

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 7

library(tidyverse)
library(gghighlight)
library(coolorrr)
library(qss)
set_theme()
set_palette()

data("florida")

florida$county[
  florida$county == "PalmBeach"
] <- "Palm Beach"

ggplot(florida) +
  aes(
    x = Perot96, 
    y = Buchanan00
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = county)
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm"
  ) + 
  gghighlight(
    county == "Palm Beach"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = scales::comma
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::comma
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Votes for Perot",
    y = "Votes for Buchanan",
    title = "Florida third party candidate results in 1996 and 2000",
    subtitle = paste0(
      "Palm Beach had unusually high support for\n",
      "Pat Buchanan in 2000 given its level of support\n",
      "for Ross Perot in 1996.\n"
    )
  )
