\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

War, wealth, and world politics are in the title of this course, but
this course is not really about war \emph{or} wealth \emph{or} world
politics. It is about the study of collective action problems under
anarchy.

These problems involve war, wealth, and world politics, but the field of
International Relations (IR) at its root is about how actors interact
and solve (or fail to solve) problems in the absence of government. IR
scholars use a variety of theories to explain why countries interact the
way the do, and a range of tools to test those theories. In this class,
you'll be introduced to some of these theories and (since this is a
\emph{Data} for Political Research course) quantitative data used to put
these theories to the test.

Some of the issues we'll consider range from:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Disease and Climate} \space \space Health crises like COVID-19
and climate change pose an existential threats to the world's
population. How can the governments of the world come together to
address crises like these that don't respect sovereign borders?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Violent Conflict} \space \space Russia's invasion of Ukraine has
resulted in the deaths of nearly half a million (so far) and the
displacement of millions more, all the while producing disastrous
economic reverberations throughout the globe. Are there ways to resolve
disputes short of war, and why is violence sometimes unavoidable?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Rivalry and Competition} \space \space China has risen from a
minor actor in geopolitics and the world economy to a major military
rival and economic competitor with the United States and its allies.
Will Beijing learn to play by the rules of the Liberal International
Order, or will it establish a new international order based on its
geopolitical and economic interests?
\end{quote}

We'll consider these problems and more in this course. Though we won't
be able to solve all of them, what is most important is that you come to
learn how IR scholars understand, study, and bring the tools of
scientific inquiry to bear in examining these complicated and weighty
issues.

\section{Course Objectives}\label{course-objectives}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Understand the actors, issues, and theories relevant for understanding
  and explaining international politics.
\item
  Along the way, gain exposure to the ways IR scholars use quantitative
  data.
\item
  Become a better informed, critical consumer of current events by
  developing the ability to put a single global event into its broader
  context. That is, learn to ask, ``what is this recent event \emph{an
  example of}?'' rather than ``what are the specifics of a recent
  event?''
\item
  Practice written and verbal communication, working as an individual
  and in groups.
\item
  Practice critically evaluating GenAI (Generative AI) as a resource for
  understanding world politics.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{course-outline}{%
\section{Course Outline}\label{course-outline}}

To meet these objectives, the course is structured around three units:

\hypertarget{unit-1-actors-issues-globalization-1}{%
\paragraph{Unit 1: Actors, Issues, \&
Globalization}\label{unit-1-actors-issues-globalization-1}}

In this first unit, we'll set the stage for international politics.
We'll identify key actors (\emph{states} and \emph{non-state actors})
and concepts (\emph{sovereignty}, \emph{anarchy}, \emph{hierarchy},
\emph{governance}), and discuss a range of issues (from \emph{trade} and
\emph{migration}, to \emph{political violence} and \emph{climate
change}).

\hypertarget{unit-2-theories-and-zombies-1}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Unit 2: Theories (and
\emph{Zombies})}{Unit 2: Theories (and Zombies)}}\label{unit-2-theories-and-zombies-1}}

In the second unit, we'll consider various theories of international
politics. We'll discuss the ``big 3'' (\emph{Realism},
\emph{Liberalism}, and \emph{Constructivism}) as well as other important
theories (\emph{Feminism}, \emph{Postcolonialism}, \emph{Network
Theory}, and much more). As we discuss these theories, we'll take a
brief detour from reality to consider what IR theories predict would

\hypertarget{unit-3-war-and-order-1}{%
\paragraph{Unit 3: War and Order}\label{unit-3-war-and-order-1}}

In the final unit, we'll conclude by taking a close look at trends in
international conflict (one of the most provocative and destructive
turns international politics can take). Has conflict become less common
and deadly over time? What role does \textbf{international order} play
in the waxing and waning of violence?

\hypertarget{the-instructor-thats-me}{%
\subsection{The Instructor (that's me!)}\label{the-instructor-thats-me}}

During my office hours, my door is always open! If you have any
questions or concerns about the course, just drop by my office Monday,
Wednesday, or Friday between 2:30-3:30 pm. No appointment necessary. If
those hours don't work for you, we can email to work out a different
time to meet.

You can also email me at
\href{mailto:williamsmd@denison.edu}{\nolinkurl{williamsmd@denison.edu}}
any time. I'll try to respond as quickly as possible, but if you email
me after 5 pm, you may not get a response from me until the next
workday.

\hypertarget{accessibility}{%
\subsection{Accessibility}\label{accessibility}}

Students with a documented disability should complete a Semester Request
for Accommodations through the MyAccommodations app on MyDenison. It is
the student's responsibility to contact me privately as soon as possible
to discuss specific needs and make arrangements well in advance of an
evaluation. I rely on the Academic Resource Center (ARC) located in 020
Higley Hall, to verify the need for reasonable accommodations based on
the documentation on file in that office. Reasonable accommodations
cannot be applied retroactively and therefore ideally should be enacted
early in the semester as they are not automatically carried forward from
a previous term and must be requested every semester.

\hypertarget{writing-center}{%
\subsection{Writing Center}\label{writing-center}}

Staffed by student Writing Consultants, the Writing Center is a free
resource available to all Denison students. Writing Consultants from a
range of majors work with writers one-on-one in all phases of the
writing process, including (but not limited to): deciphering
assignments, discussing ideas, developing an argument, integrating
research and sources, working with faculty feedback, and/or polishing a
draft. In addition, Consultants are happy to help with all types of
writing, from lab reports, research papers, and informal writing
assignments to cover letters, personal statements, and other application
materials. The Center welcomes writers from all backgrounds and levels
of college preparation, including multilingual writers. Should a
multilingual writer need writing assistance that exceeds the abilities
of consultants, the writer can be referred to the Coordinator for
Multilingual Learning, Kaly Thayer
(\href{mailto:thayerk@denison.edu}{\nolinkurl{thayerk@denison.edu}}).
Writing Center consultations will take place in person in in the Atrium
level of the Library; please visit the Writing Center's page
(\url{https://my.denison.edu/campus-resources/writing-center}) on
MyDenison for specific information regarding hours of availability and
how to schedule an appointment. The Writing Center strongly recommends
signing up for appointments in advance.

\hypertarget{multilingual-support-l2}{%
\subsection{Multilingual Support (L2)}\label{multilingual-support-l2}}

Students who use English in addition to other languages are welcome to
use the resources available at the Multilingual Learning Office. Kaly
Thayer, the Assistant Director of Multilingual Learning, and Anna Adams,
the English Language Support Specialist, as well the student consultants
who work with them, are trained and experienced in helping students
address the different issues that arise when working in more than one
language. If English is not your first or only language, please consider
utilizing this resource, which is available to ALL Denison students.
Ms.~Thayer, Ms.~Adams, and the student consultants offer a variety of
support for L2 students, including consulting with you about your
written language (grammar, syntax, word-choices), strategies to manage
your reading assignments, assistance with class conversation and
presentations, and help devising ways to develop and effectively use all
your skills in English. You can set up an appointment via MyDenison -
Campus Resources - Multilingual Learning, or by emailing the
Multilingual Learning Office directly at
\href{mailto:englishhelp@denison.edu}{\nolinkurl{englishhelp@denison.edu}}.

\hypertarget{reporting-sexual-assault}{%
\subsection{Reporting Sexual Assault}\label{reporting-sexual-assault}}

Essays, journals, and other coursework submitted for this class are
generally considered confidential pursuant to the University's student
record policies. However, students should be aware that University
employees are required by University policy to report allegations of
discrimination based on sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression,
sexual orientation or pregnancy to the Title IX Coordinator or a Deputy
Title IX Coordinator. This includes reporting all incidents of sexual
misconduct, sexual assault and suspected abuse/neglect of a minor.
Further, employees are to report these incidents that occur on campus
and/or that involve students at Denison University whenever the employee
becomes aware of a possible incident in the course of their employment,
including via coursework or advising conversations. There are others on
campus to whom you may speak in confidence, including clergy and medical
staff and counselors at the Wellness Center. More information on Title
IX and the University's Policy prohibiting sex discrimination, including
sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, stalking and retaliation,
including support resources, how to report, and prevention and education
efforts, can be found at: \url{https://denison.edu/campus/title-ix} .

\hypertarget{course-policy}{%
\section{Course Policy}\label{course-policy}}

The course policy and requirements are detailed below. It all basically
boils down to: (1) show up to class, (2) learn some stuff, and (3) don't
cheat or trick me into believing you've accomplished 2.

\hypertarget{grading-policy}{%
\subsection{Grading Policy}\label{grading-policy}}

Grades at Denison are based on a standard 4.0 scale. You can read more
about Denison's grading system
\href{https://catalog.denison.edu/catalog/academic-program/grading-system-evaluation/}{here}.
Generally, a 90 corresponds to an A\(-\), an 80 to a B\(-\), etc.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule()
\textbf{Grading Scale} & & \\
\midrule()
\endhead
A+: 98\%+ & A: 92\% & A-: 90\% \\
B+: 88\% & B: 82\% & B-: 80\% \\
C+: 78\% & C: 72\% & C-: 70\% \\
D+: 68\% & D: 62\% & D-: 60\% \\
F: below 60 & & \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

\emph{Attendance and Participation} \textbf{10\%}

\begin{quote}
You should show up to class and participate! Missing multiple days of
class can leave gaps in your learning that make doing assignments down
the road more difficult. We'll also have some class days dedicated to
in-depth discussion of an academic article or other reading material. If
you don't show up, you can't participate in the discussion or provide me
with evidence that you even did the reading. As an incentive to show up
(both physically and mentally) to class, 10 percent of your grade will
come from attendance and participation. Your first unexcused absence
will be a freebie. After that, you'll lose 1/2 of your attendance and
participation grade per each of two subsequent unexcused absences. That
means after 3 unexcused absences you'll lose your entire grade for
attendance and participation. Also, if you just come to class, but don't
engage, you'll lose 1/2 of your attendance and participation grade as
well. {[}\textbf{Note}: \emph{Participation does not only look like
talking in class. If you don't feel comfortable or confident (but I hope
you do!) speaking up, we'll do some work in groups as well. If you
participate in your group, that counts as participation, too!}{]}
\end{quote}

\emph{3 Short Essays} \textbf{15\% Each}

\begin{quote}
You'll have three short essays to complete in this course. These will
come at the end of each of our three units and should be anywhere from
700 to 1,200 words. You'll be given a prompt at least 2 weeks in advance
of the essay due date. You'll be asked to take a stance on an issue or
debate related to our unit material and provide supporting evidence or
claims in suppport of your position. These will be worth 15\% of your
grade each and combined make up 45\% of your final grade. Prompts will
be posted to Canvas.
\end{quote}

\emph{3 Talking with Data Assignments} \textbf{10\% Each}

\begin{quote}
These are collaborative (i.e., group) assignments that we will do three
times throughout the semester. I will divide you into working-groups,
and your task will be to explore and vizualize data related to a
collective action problem in IR or break down an academic article and
make its conclusions digestible for a smart (but unfamiliar) audience.
This does not include a written component. Instead, you will put
together a short presentation for the class (usually no longer than 10
minutes). No technical skills beyond using a drop-down menu and working
with PowerPoint or Google Slides will be required. I will provide the
relevant datasets (and web applications) or articles for you. Further
details about these tasks will be provided on Canvas. These will be
worth a combined 30\% of your final grade and will be graded on a group
rather than individual basis.
\end{quote}

\emph{Grade the AI} \textbf{15\% Total}

\begin{quote}
This is a weekly individual assignment worth a combined 15\% of your
final grade. Generative AI (GenAI) is here, and it's here to stay. That
means you need to learn how to use it, and using it well requires
critical thinking. Not every response GenAI provides is accurate. If
you've used tools like ChatGPT, you know that they can hallucinate,
giving you nice sounding but ultimately inaccurate or misleading answers
to your questions. That means an ability to check and evaluate the
responses from GenAI is a critical skill to develop. In these weekly
assignments, you'll get practice using this skill. I'll give you a
prompt each week asking a question relavent to the material we cover in
class. You'll then give this prompt to ChatGPT. You'll copy the response
to a Google or Word doc, and then you give it a letter grade from
``A''-``F'' and write a short paragraph justifying your evaluation of
the response. I'll then grade your effort in evaluating ChatGPT.
\end{quote}

The following figure provides a summary of my grading strategy and
philosophy. For each assignment you submit, I'll evaluate it on a
discrete scale from 0 to 5. 5 = ``Perfection!'' and 0 = ``Missing''
(e.g., you didn't turn anything in). Your points then get mapped to a
percentage point grade for a given assignment according to what I call a
``Grace Curve.'' This means the linkages between my evaluation of your
work on the 0-5 scale and your actual grade are not one-to-one. 5 out of
5 = 100\% (an ``A+''), but 4 out of 5 = 93\% (still an ``A'') and 3 out
of 5 = 85\% (a ``B''), and so on. If you do some simple math, you know
that 4 out 5 should actually be 80\% and 3 out of 5 should be 60\% if I
didn't apply the Grace Curve. My grading strategy gives me a simple
scale to evaluate your work, but it also ensures that you get some
benefit of the doubt. Did you completely bomb an assignment? My instinct
is to give you a 1 out of 5, which gives you only 20\% for your final
grade on said assignment. That seems too harsh. My scale adjusts for my
disappointment in the quality of your work and gives you 60\% (a ``D-'')
instead. That's still a poor grade, but not one that would be impossible
to recover from.

\hypertarget{e-mail-policy}{%
\subsection{E-mail Policy}\label{e-mail-policy}}

I have a simple email policy, and it is targeted at achieving one goal:
\textbf{maximizing your and my work-life balance}. The policy is this:

\begin{quote}
I promise a timely response to \textbf{relevant} emails I receive
between \textbf{9:00 AM} and \textbf{5:00 PM} Monday to Friday.
\end{quote}

You may not think professors have lives (but we in fact do, and I like
to live mine outside of normal working hours). That doesn't mean I
expect students to abide by chrono-normative standards.\footnote{By
  this, I simply mean classic societal expectations about working
  vs.~leisure hours.} But, this does mean that if you email me outside
of these windows, I may not respond until the next 9-5 workday.

\hypertarget{make-up-assigment-policy}{%
\subsection{Make-Up Assigment Policy}\label{make-up-assigment-policy}}

There are \textbf{NO} make-ups for missed assignments. Don't bother
asking. But, if you anticipate having troubles making a due-date and
notify me \textbf{\emph{in advance}}, we can work out a solution.

\hypertarget{second-chances-policy}{%
\subsection{Second Chances Policy}\label{second-chances-policy}}

You have only one chance with your assignments, but only one chance
should be necessary. If you have questions or concerns, come visit me
during office hours, send me and email, or take advantage of the various
resources we have on campus. I and so many others on campus are eager
and willing to help if you ask. Take advantage of these opportunities
\emph{before} you submit your work. You won't get a second chance after.

\hypertarget{attendance-policy}{%
\subsection{Attendance Policy}\label{attendance-policy}}

Attendance is part of your grade (see ``Grading Policy''). However,
sometimes life happens. There's an emergency, you get sick, you're an
athlete and you have to be out of town, etc. Any of these exigencies can
be the basis for an excused absence (which means missing class won't
count against your final grade). All I ask is that you do me the
courtesy of telling me \textbf{in advance} of your absence and your
justification. After the fact is too late (except in the case of a true
and immediate emergency).

\hypertarget{computer-based-excuses}{%
\subsection{Computer-based Excuses}\label{computer-based-excuses}}

Excuses for late or missed assignments based on CD, flash drive, or hard
drive errors are \textbf{not acceptable}. If you use your Google Drive,
all your work will be backed up and easy to access.

\hypertarget{late-assigments}{%
\subsection{Late Assigments}\label{late-assigments}}

We have a lot of work to do in this class. So turn in your work when
it's due. This is meant to help you. I love to procrastinate just as
much as anyone else---but if you procrastinate in this course, you will
drown. As incentive for keeping on top of your assignments, each day
your assignment is late and unexcused (including weekends and holidays)
you will lose 5 percent from your final grade for that assignment. There
will be no exceptions made for work that is submitted only minutes after
a deadline. If something is due by midnight on a Friday (12:00 AM), the
moment the clock strikes 12:01 AM your assignment is a day late and you
will automatically lose 5\% from your grade.

The exception to this rule is if a student and I have worked out an
arrangement for submitting an assignment at a later date.

\hypertarget{electronic-submission}{%
\subsection{Electronic Submission}\label{electronic-submission}}

You will submit all of your assignments electronically via Canvas.

\hypertarget{academic-dishonesty-policy}{%
\subsection{Academic Dishonesty
Policy}\label{academic-dishonesty-policy}}

Don't cheat. Just don't do it.

It should go without saying, but \textbf{\emph{plagiarism}} is also a
form of cheating and it includes:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Copying or paraphrasing the ideas of others without citation or
  attribution.
\item
  Copying or paraphrasing the ideas of \textbf{\emph{other students in
  the class}}.
\end{enumerate}

I've had to deal with students plagiarizing before. It's painful for me
and it puts a blight on the record of the student. It's not only
cheating, it's stealing.

When in doubt about whether something constitutes cheating, consult
Denison's \href{https://denison.edu/academics/curriculum/integrity}{Code
of Academic
Integrity}.\footnote{Of course, if you have to ask yourself if something counts as cheating, then it probably is...}
Be advised that this same Code of Academic Integrity requires that
instructors notify the Associate Provost of cases of academic
dishonesty. \textbf{Any incidence of academic dishonesty will result in
failure of the course and referral to the Denison judicial process.}

\hypertarget{academic-dishonest-and-generative-ai}{%
\subsection{Academic Dishonest and Generative
AI}\label{academic-dishonest-and-generative-ai}}

Remember the previous section where I said you shouldn't cheat? That
also applies to GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) tools like
ChatGPT. \textbf{\emph{But}}, there's some nuance to my attitude about
GenAI and academic dishonesty. GenAI is a powerful \emph{tool}, and it's
a tool that you need to learn to use well because, let's face it, a lot
of other people are using it, too. That's why one of your assignments is
specifically centered around evaluating GenAI. However, beyond this
assignment I also want to be very clear that \textbf{\emph{I am okay if
you use GenAI tools to help you with your work.}} I've started using
ChatGPT to help me with some aspects of my own research and programming.
It would be unfair to me to hold you all to a different standard than I
hold myself.

So, here's my policy on using GenAI: You can use it, but I want you to
be honest about it, and I DO NOT want you to use it uncritically or
unthinkingly. What does this look like? \textbf{Do not} copy and paste
responses or output from tools like ChatGPT and pass them off as your
own. \textbf{Do} use ChatGPT if you get stuck and need help (just make
sure you tell me about it, and that you add your own thoughts, writing,
and ideas into the mix as well). For ``Grade the AI'' assignments in
particular, this means your evaluation of the generated response must be
your own.

Ultimately, I hope this policy strikes a realistic balance between
honesty and exploration of the potential uses of GenAI and ensuring your
own ``sweat equity'' (effort) goes into your course work as well. I want
you to be honest if and when you use GenAI because I'm genuinely curious
about its applications. I'm still learning how to use it, too, and I
hope that we all can learn how to use it better \emph{together.}
Further, I want you to use it critically and thoughtfully because it
doesn't work perfectly. While it's powerful (and shockingly so), it is
not all-powerful. You need to put in plenty of your own work as well.

You'll probably see a wide variety of attitudes toward GenAI from
different faculty on campus. Some attitudes will differ from mine. As
instructors, we're still trying to figure out the best policy. Have
patience with us!
